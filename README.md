# Voice-Assistant
I'ts just a voice asistant for windows and android but sometimes not working in android maybe because of the some libraries.
If you want compile to android, you must use ubuntu and buildozer. Also you can use PyInstaller library for windows.(I propose windows platform)
But first for all you must some libraries.
