# Voice-Assistant
I'ts just a voice assistant for windows and android but sometimes not working in android.

If you want compile to android, you must use ubuntu and buildozer. Also you can use PyInstaller library for windows.(I propose windows platform)
But first for all you must import some libraries.

pip install kivy

pip insatll kivymd

pip install playsound

pip install gTTS

pip install speech_recognition

than you can use :)


IMPORTANT WARNING: Use Python 3.6.8 version because speech_recognition library sometimes has not working other versions.
